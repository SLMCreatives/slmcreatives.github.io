            </h2>
            <p>
                Sending the <em>right</em> message about your brand and using the right language, design and theme is a sure fire way to establish trust and trustworthiness among your potential customers.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Being consistent with your content let's people know that you are there for them. By providing insight, giving tips, guidance and advice while going deep into a topic can really help your followers understand exactly what you have to offer.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Building an online community outside of your client base is the first benchmark to achieve which opens up your brand to new horizons. This gives you a clearer picture of who your audience is, how they behave and what they think of your company.

            <em>What Sort Of Content Do I Post?</em>
            <h2>Industry Relevant Content </h2> 
            <p>My main referrence would be what everyone else in your industry is posting. This is usually the most engaging content and information that is relevant and valuable to your target audience. Adding your own unique angle and twist is somthing tha I specialise in.</p>
            <h2>Branding Content</h2>
            <p>Visuals and videos that help your message reach your audience and strenghthen your brand image. I take your existing image and turn it into a journey that your audience can take with you.</p>
            <h2>Annoucements and Festivals</h2>
            <p>Any updates that you share about your events, compaigns and season greetings. This is a great way to keep your aiudience close, and show that they are an important part of your organisation. </p>
